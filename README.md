A collaborate effort to create an open sourced HomeMatic-aware distribution for the RaspberryPi platform based on buildroot.

## WARNING
This repository is Work-in-Progress and not yet ment to provide a productive HomeMatic-compatible distribution for the RaspberryPi

## ChangeLog

* 0.2.0 (Not yet released)
  * HomeMatic-CCU 2.25.14 compatibility
  * working Backup / Restore / Factory-Reset
  * finalized Filesystem structure (read-only root file system)
  * working addon install/removal routines

* 0.1.0 (2016-08-21)
  * First development version. There are still broken features like filesystem structure (readonly root file system), backup, restore, install extensions..., but it's possible to teach-in and controll HomeMatic RF devices.
